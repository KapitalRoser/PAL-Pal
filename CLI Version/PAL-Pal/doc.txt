WELCOME TO PAL XD!

This tool ain't just your friend,
it's your PAL-Pal!

~~~~~~~~~  COMMANDS REFERENCE  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Reject - searches for and generates the next runnable Eevee.
Restore - restores the preceeding result. Can be used multiple times up to the initial result. --Still a bit buggy.
Reset - clears result data and asks for a new initial seed.
Settings - launches the requirements setup process.
Exit - exits the program.

~~~~~~~~~~~  GENERAL USAGE  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
How-to-use:
The first time you run the program it will prompt you to setup a set of requirements to search for.
This will get saved to a config file so that the next time you open the program it will remember
your settings. These can be changed at any time using the Settings command.

1) First find your seed using the standard seed finder in Aldelaro's Manip tool.
2) Review the Eevee and decide if you want to go for it. If so, it will tell you the:
# of Rerolls,
# of Memcard reloads,
# of Rumble switches and
# of Name screen backouts.

You will see a Target title screen seed below the pokemon. If you enter this into 
the main manip program in the "enter seed manually" box, your eevee will show up!
(assuming you are on PAL mode). Click it, and the teddy input boxes will open
and you can search for your teddy like normal.

You will also see what the team leads & HP values to expect on the final reroll.
Just like how Alde's tool tells you.

Perform the rerolls, then when done back out to the main menu.
From here on out you won't know for sure where you are, so take your time when counting. 

Now you perform the remaining instructions.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  INSTRUCTIONS EXPLANATION  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 - MEMORY CARD RELOAD:
    Take out Memory Card A and back out to the "press start" screen.
    Press A/Start, then when prompted press A to "continue without saving".
    (This calls RNG 1009 times exactly)
    Then back out and repeat as necessary. 
    WHEN DONE, RE-INSERT MEMORY CARD AT "Press Start" screen and Enter,
    so that the game registers your memory card. Otherwise the rumble switches won't work.

- RUMBLE SWITCH:
    Go to options, scroll to rumble and switch it from off to on, or vice versa. 
    Then hit EXIT and say YES to save. This calls rng 40 times (20 on colo) and is useful
    for making up the last few hundred calls that a reroll can't hit.

- NAME SCREEN BACKOUT:
    New Game -> up or down input -> A (Yes). Then mash B to back out to the title screen again.
    This calls rng twice, and is the most granular form of advancement we have. This does mean that
    the final target must be an even number of calls away, but since memcards are an odd number, we
    always have a path towards the target.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  OTHER INFO  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PAL has some interesting quirks that help make the eevees as easy or 
even easier to obtain than NTSC. As a side-effect of not advancing 
rng every frame in the new game screen, this game also lacks the
10% rule that prevents 10% of all seeds from being reachable.
In addition, because of how granular we can get with our actions,
then for calls >= 1009, ALL RNG SEEDS ARE POSSIBLE TO HIT.
(For runnables <1009, it's up to chance whether there is a valid
path to the target. 1.91% of seeds are in this area, and there is a
~31% chance of being salvageable. This means that 1.32% of first runnables will
be lost because they are too early :/ However, once past 1009 calls all are 
guaranteed to have a viable path).
NTSC cannot get this precise and it shows.
This is why PAL is actually so powerful. There are certain
eevee IV/Nature combos that cannot be hit on NTSC due to the 10% rule.

These advancement methods have been known to the Shiny hunter community
for a while. In the time since Aldelaro's initial RNG work, the shiny rng
community has progressed immensely, and this knowledge hasn't been brought
to the speedrunning scene. I attempt to bridge this gap with a tool like this.
Shiny hunters are patient and are okay with long, convoluted and meticulous setups.
They are about the furthest thing from "user-friendly". I hope that this tool helps
the people who have done things the manual way, as well as those who don't want
to wrangle with technical concepts just to play the game.

We do introduce a optimization problem with this program that I have yet to solve.
The current standard manip only uses the Reroll system, so there is only
1 variable to control for: rerolls.
However since we introduce 3 more ways to advance rng, we introduce a new question.
What is the "fastest" way to reach our manip target?
All the different instructions take a different amount of time.
Rerolls are the fastest, and then name screens and memcards are next at 3.7 seconds apiece.
Finally Rumble switches are the slowest at a minimum of 6 seconds, often more. Most of this
time is lost waiting for the game to finish saving. 
Currently the tool prioritizes rerolls, with an optional accomodation for an even-numbered
rumble switch count. In the future, I plan to add optimization for time, in an intelligent way.
